## East End Ink's PHP, Slim-Framework-3 Based Website



##### NOTE about Author's local development environment: For some reason, if it has problems loading files, I've been able to:

1. go to /var/www/html/nesbot.com, cd public/, php -S localhost:8000, and the nesbot.com site will work locally

THEN

2. go to /var/www/html/east-end-php-site, run 'php -S localhost:8000' and everything works fine
